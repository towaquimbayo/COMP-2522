# LabRoundup
Here is the repository for submitting lab solutions for the first eight labs. Submitting is voluntary, but I'll be giving out bonus marks for accepted pull requests. 

# Contribution method
Start by cloning the repository. Then create a branch with the style of `githubusername_lab##_shortname`. For example, I would make a branch called `pbucci_lab01_bouncefix`.

Add your lab code to the correct lab folder. Add ONLY the relevant `/src/` and/or `/test/` code. Also prefix it with your name, i.e. `lab09/paul_src`. 

Push your branch, then navigate to `Pull Requests`. Select `New Pull Request` on the righthand side and select your branch.

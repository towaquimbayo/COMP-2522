This lab completed majority of the requirement for lab06.
Most of the structures was inspired by lab 03.
Enemy character moves are a little buggy.

Two feature that was not implemented:
1. game reset when all enemy's power is more than player's power.
2. collision behaviour between player and enemy.

I hope this helps.

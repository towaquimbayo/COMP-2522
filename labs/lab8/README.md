# Lab-08

For this lab, we'll be looking at the performance of different data structures.

## TODO 1: Implement a binary search tree
In `MyBinarySearchTree`, implement the `push`, `get` and `clear` methods according to the following specification. 

A [Binary Search Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree) guarantees that for each node, all the children on the left are less than all of the children on the right.

## TODO 2: Implement a recency dictionary
In `MyRecencyDictionary`, implement the `push`, `get` and `clear` methods according to the following specification.

A **Recency Dictionary** guarantees that the most recently accessed items are the fastest to access again. 

Using the `Node` class and whatever other supporting data structures you would like (except for exact Java duplicates of these data structures), make it so that the test suite passes.

## TODO 3: Implement your own data structure
Define your own key-value store data structure in `MyDataStructure`. Implement the `push`, `get` and `clear` methods. Write how your data structure works in a JavaDoc comment.

## TODO 4: Stress-test your data structure
The `Main` method contains our DIY profiler. Enter your GitHub teamname in place of "pbucci". Then test your data structure against the Java HashMap and the two you've created for this lab. I'll run a tournament across the class: bonus marks will be given for fastest `push` and fastest `get`.

# Project TODOs
This week you'll start to implement your project. Complete the following for next week:

## TODO 1: Create a GitHub issue for implementing the UML diagram
Start by creating a single GitHub issue for implementing your UML diagram in code. Implement it. Close the issue. Show Paul that you have done this. 

## TODO 2: Sketch out the attributes and methods you need in each class on paper
Each class will need attributes and methods. Plan them on your UML diagram. Change your UML diagram if you need.

## TODO 3: Create GitHub issues for each set of tasks
Decide amongst your group which level of granularity you'd like to track your issues at. At the lowest level of granularity, one issue per feature/bug is a minimum standard. Assign each issue to a group member.

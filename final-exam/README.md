Welcome to the COMP 2522 Final! This exam is different than the midterm exam. For this exam, all questions are required for full marks. They are longer questions with multiple parts to them. The best marks will be for meeting and exceeding the requirements, i.e., code that just "technically works" will not guarantee you full marks. Code with good design, style, and clever solutions will be given top marks. 

If you're stuck on something, clearly state your assumptions in comments and make decisions about what you'd like the code to do. Multiple solutions will be correct for the given requirements, so demonstrate your knowledge to the best of your ability.

## Materials
You are required to bring your own computer. Make sure it is CHARGED since there is no guarantee of enough power outlets in the room.

You should bring a pen for writing answers to diagram questions. Paper will be provided.

You are allowed any number of written materials or physical items that are not internet-capable or able to run arbitrary code. So, e.g., calculators and geometry sets are allowed, but no smart phones or watches.

## Plagiarism and Rules for Accessing Information
You are allowed to access a limited number of websites:
- Anything from [GitHub.com](http://github.com) is allowed to be READ only.
- Anything from [Docs.Oracle.com](https://docs.oracle.com/) is allowed to be READ only.
- Anything from [DevDocs.io](https://devdocs.io/) is allowed to be READ only.
- Anything from [W3Schools.com](http://w3schools.com) is allowed to be READ only.
- Anything from [RefactoringGuru](https://refactoring.guru/) is allowed to be READ only.
- Anything from [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) is allowed to be READ only.

READ only means you're allowed to read, but not copy-paste. See below.

No other web access is allowed, i.e.,
- NO communication platforms of any kind
- NO Q&A sites such as Stack Overflow
- NO Google (use the internal search tools for GitHub/Oracle)
- NO downloading and using external packages

However, anything that is already installed/given to you through the course IDE installation is allowed. So, no extra plugins, but using the current plugins, even if they access the internet for some of their operations, is allowed.

Otherwise, the exam is open book. Anything that's on your own computer already is allowed, including previous lab assignments, etc. 

Standard plagarism rules still apply: if I can tell that you're just copy-pasting without modification, even from your own previous work, it will be considered plagiarism. You are welcome to review your previous work and type out new solutions to it, but not to copy-paste. I'll be running the exams through my own NLP system to check for this.

Last, there shall be NO DISTRIBUTION of this exam to others in your own class or others. Sharing answers and questions will be considered academic dishonesty and grounds for a citation.

## Timing and Handin
You have two hours for the exam. The latest commit to GitHub BEFORE the deadline will be marked, all later commits will be automatically removed, so commit early and often. Questions about diagrams will be answered on paper only. Papers for diagrams will be collected at the end of the exam period.
